          Football Club Metalist Kharkiv is a Ukrainian football club based in Kharkiv that plays 
          in the Ukrainian First League during the 2023-24 season. It was revived five years after 
          the original FC Metalist Kharkiv ceased operations. Founded in 1925, FC Metalist Kharkiv 
          had worked its way up the rungs of the Soviet football system, eventually being promoted 
          to the Soviet Top League in 1960. After a difficult period which included relegation, 
          Metalist was promoted to the Top League again in 1982, where it remained until the league's 
          dissolution.

          Following the demise of Metalist Kharkiv in 2016, two new clubs were created in Kharkiv with 
          variations of the Metalist club name. Since July 2016, a team named "SK Metalist Kharkiv" has 
          been playing in the Kharkiv Oblast Championship,[4] whose owner is Metalist owner Serhiy 
          Kurchenko.[5] In August 2016, another club named "FC Metalist 1925 Kharkiv" began to operate 
          in the Ukrainian Amateur Football League[6] with the stated intention of competing in the 
          (professional) Ukrainian Second League as soon as possible.[6] "FC Metalist 1925 Kharkiv" is 
          owned by a company not linked with the original FC Metalist Kharkiv.[7][6]
          In October 2017, a Ukrainian court confiscated (the original) Metalist Kharkiv from Kurchenko
          and placed it under state property.[8] At the time the club did not participate in any 
          official sanctioned competitions.[8] Also in July 2020, former FC Metalist sports director 
          Yevhen Krasnikov created FC Metal Kharkiv which has since participated in the Ukrainian 
          Second League. Earlier on 5 May 2020, Oleksandr Yaroslavskyi announced that he wishes to 
          take care of the debts of the liquidated Metalist.[9][10][11][12] The return of Yaroslavskyi
          to football arose some criticism connected with politics of the city of Kharkiv.[13] After
          winning the Second League in June 2021, it was confirmed that Metal will be renamed to 
          Metalist and the old FC Metalist Kharkiv logo will be returned to the club, along with its 
          brand and history.[14]
